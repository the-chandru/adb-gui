# This .gitignore file is designed to ignore common files and directories
# that should not be committed to Git repositories.
# It covers OS-specific files, IDE files, build artifacts,
# dependency manager directories, and sensitive data.

*.rar                 *.7z            # Other archive formats

# --- Sensitive Data / Configuration (Should NEVER be committed) ---
# Ensure these are not accidentally committed.
# Create template files for these and instruct developers to copy and fill.
.env                  # Environment variables (e.g., for backend apps)
.env.*.local          # Local environment variables
config.local.js       # Local configuration files
secrets.plist         # iOS/macOS property list with secrets
APIKeys.swift         # Swift file with API keys
*.pem                 # Private keys
*.key                 # Private keys
*.cert                # Certificates
*.p12                 # PKCS#12 archives
*.mobileprovision     # iOS provisioning profiles

# --- Xcodeproj (More specific exclusions, if not handled by above) ---
# Generally, the .xcodeproj folder itself IS committed, but internal user-specific
# or generated files within it are excluded.
# If you are using a project generator like XcodeGen, the .xcodeproj itself might be ignored.
# For manual projects, these are good to ignore:
*.xcodeproj/project.xcworkspace/       # User's workspace settings within the project bundle
# The following usually IS committed for shared schemes/configurations
# *.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/

# Xcode specific cache directories and files that should not be committed.
